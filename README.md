- CWMSv5, by me and my dear Brother (a lot of Code was re-used, remade, and fixed, from there, it's YaBS' base, after all).
- AcmlmBoard XD, by Dirbaio, xfix, Kawa, StapleButter, Nina, et al (Smileys, and some CSS stuff were 'borrowed' from there).
- People at StackExchange (always helpful).
- W3Schools, and PHP.net (which made the Switch from MySQL to MySQLi so easy).
- WordPress (thanks to that, I started to make YaBS, because I found it way to heavy).
- You (who will hopefully extend, and improve YaBS, together with us).
